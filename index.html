                    <p>I’m Liza. I am a planner. I was always looking for the next thing. So, the traveler lifestyle quickly became quite addictive. I lived abroad for 4 years from Spain to Colombia to Ecuador, which meant I was constantly on the go and “getting to know myself”. Or, so I thought. Even after I got a massive blood clot in my arm, I just kept going, desperately looking for the next thing. It wasn’t until COVID began when I made the time to go on a daily walk that I surrendered. I stopped planning. I listened to my body. I tapped into my inner essence. My entelechy. I realized she’s been telling me to get into coding for a long time. So, I finally listened. I am becoming a Full-Stack Web Developer. </p>
